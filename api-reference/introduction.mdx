## Welcome

Once your account is created, you will be able to access the All Rise AI API. The API is organized around REST. To get started, you will need to request your API key from the All Rise AI team.
## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens. To authenticate your requests, include the token in the `Authorization` header.

```http
Authorization
Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```
