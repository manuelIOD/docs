## Welcome

Once your account is created, you will be able to access the All Rise AI API. The API is organized around REST. To get started, you will need to request your API key from the All Rise AI team.
## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens. To authenticate your requests, include the api token or location key in the `Authorization` header. We will let you know when you need to use the api token or location key.

```http
Authorization
Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```
